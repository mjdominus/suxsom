Items I will need if I want to replace blosxom:

o Load article and its metadata into database as a sux
o Select articles matching some criterion, create a sux representing
  the article sequence (probably need a new kind of suxgroup table or
  something)
o Generate an HTML file corresponding to a suxgroup
