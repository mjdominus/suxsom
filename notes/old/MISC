* Input items represent input sources.  Products are aggregations that
  show which groups of inputs turn into an output.

* These whould probably be objects, not simple aggregates.

* Eventually you will want to have everything ignore files that
  haven't changed since the last run.  Maybe each plugin can have a
  scratch directory where it can store its results, then fetch them
  back when needed.
