Plugins required before I can abandon Blosxom, in order of importance:

Core functions:

  scanfiles: scan the input directories and generate a product
  for each input file found

  readfiles: load input files into each product

  Next four generate products that just group the input items into articles.

      main: mappings for main page and index.atom index.rss
      indexes: mappings for subject index pages (e.g., math/index.html,rss,atom)
      articles: mappings for single-article files
      dates: mappings for redirection pages for /2013/05/09/index.html

  These three takes the grouping objects from the previous four and build actual outputs:

      atom: build atom files
      rss: build rss files
      html: build html files

  redirect: build redirection pages

  writefiles: Write output data of finished products to the proper files

Important features:

  markdown: markdown processing

  nonotyet: disable items marked as Published: 0 or Published: (future date)
            or that are accompanied by .notyet files

  meta: META section removal and META database maintenance
  tags: maintain tag database

  macros: macro processing
  booklink: booklink processing
  formula: formula processing
  toc: build toc for sidebar
