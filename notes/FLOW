We are eliminating input and output items.  Everything is simply a
"product".  A product might contain an input filename, 
or an input filename plus its contents,
or it might represent a multiple-article page, 
in which case it will contain a list of the other product objects that 
hold the content.

Gnerating the blog will go something like this:

1. scanfiles will generate an input-file product node for each input
   file it finds

2. readfiles will read in the contents of each files into the input nodes

3. meta will process meta sections in each item; should-be-published will mark each item as suitable for publication, or not; update metadata database; update tag database, etc.

4. Some other plugins (mainpage, subject-archive, date-archive) will
generate accumulation nodes that group input items into files

5. Some other plugins (html, rss, atom) will generate product files
that represent the output files and contain the actual output content

6. writefiles will write out the output product files
